# Welcome to Ferret!

Ferret is a web scraping system. It aims to simplify data extraction from the web for UI testing, machine learning, analytics and more.    
Ferret allows users to focus on the data. It abstracts away the technical details and complexity of underlying technologies using its own declarative language.    
It is extremely flexible, powerful, easy to learn and use.

## Where to start
You can start by reading the [introduction post on our website](https://www.montferret.dev/blog/say-hello-to-ferret/) and get your hands dirty with the [getting started guide](https://www.montferret.dev/docs/getting-started/).

## Ecosystem
Ferret system contains multiple tools and components.    
- [Ferret runtime](https://github.com/MontFerret/ferret) is the core of the system that contains the language parser and execution runtime engine. It's designed to be portable and can be embedded to any application.
- [CLI](https://github.com/MontFerret/cli) is a command-line tool that allows you to run Ferret scripts from the terminal. Good for quick testing and debugging.
- [Worker](https://github.com/MontFerret/worker) is a HTTP server that allows you to run Ferret scripts as a service. Good for building scalable and distributed systems.
- [Lab](https://github.com/MontFerret/lab) is a test runner that allows you to write and run UI tests using Ferret scripts. Good for building test suites and running them in CI/CD pipelines.
- [Chromium](https://github.com/MontFerret/chromium) is a Dockerized headless Chromium that is used by Ferret to execute scripts. It's based on the latest version of the Chromium browser and is optimized for running in headless environments.
- [VS Code Syntax Highlighting](https://github.com/MontFerret/vscode-fql-syntax) is a Visual Studio Code extension that provides syntax highlighting for Ferret Query Language.
- [Ferret Playground](https://www.montferret.dev/try/) is an online playground that allows you to write and run Ferret scripts in the browser. Good for quick prototyping and sharing.
